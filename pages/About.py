This Track & Field Odds Dashboard helps visualize pre-race betting odds and predicted race times for major athletics competitions. 
Built using Python, Streamlit, and R, this tool integrates data from World Athletics to analyze athletics results.

<br>
<br>
The goal is to provide both predictive insight and retrospective evaluation of athlete performance, using both predicted time and value-based metrics such as "worth". 
In a sport built upon numbers, we believed there was a lack of predictive analytics. Our hope is that the insights shown in this dashboard increase the accessibility of the sport. 

<br>
<br>
            
Since this is our first iteration, we are open to feedback on how to improve this dashboard in the future.
